# Command to re-generate the audio soundtrack from the demo

    echo "deck.browsercast.js is a deck.js extension. It can replay a pre-recorded audio soundtrack and synchronize it with deck.js slides. It also helps in recording the timings and synchronize them with the soundtrack. Thank you very much for your attention." | text2wave | oggenc -o synth.ogg -
